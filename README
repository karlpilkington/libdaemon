libdaemon
---------
author: kyle isom 

libdaemon is a lightweight daemon framework for OpenBSD. It provides 
facilities for logging and a signal handler to enable graceful shutdown, 
as well as file locking to ensure that only a single copy of a given daemon 
is running at a time. Currently, libdaemon is not threaded.

supported platforms:    

+  OpenBSD
+  Linux


Tests
-----

libdaemon ships with a 'check' target for make. It produces two binaries:
src/testcore and src/testd. 

testd will create ~/.testd and populate it with testd.pid. After running
it, you should see messages in /var/log/messages (or where ever syslog
logs to) and it should show up in the process list. It can be killed using
kill -SIGUSR1 $(cat ~/.testd/testd.pid)
