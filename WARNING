WARNING
libdaemon is currently in the middle of a rewrite to a new architecure.

libdaemon's API is currently in flux as I experiment with how best to
implement certain functionality. If you desire the old API, and don't care
that it has to be run with root privileges (which it will drop), grab the
tarball from the github project page's file downloads section.

you have been warned.
