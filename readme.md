author: kyle isom 

libdaemon is a lightweight daemon framework for OpenBSD. It provides 
facilities for logging and a signal handler to enable graceful shutdown, 
as well as file locking to ensure that only a single copy of a given daemon 
is running at a time. Currently, libdaemon is not threaded.

support platforms:    

+  OpenBSD
